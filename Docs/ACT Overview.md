# ACT model - White Paper

---

## Executive Summary

A Curious Tractor (ACT) is a regenerative innovation ecosystem partnering with marginalised—especially First Nations—communities to dismantle extractive systems. ACT blends deep listening, co-design, storytelling, technology and place-based enterprise so that social, cultural, environmental and economic value remains in community hands. To do this at scale, ACT is adopting a dual-entity structure (charitable CLG + mission-locked trading arm) that preserves grant eligibility while enabling equitable profit-sharing. Flagship “seed projects” such as Empathy Ledger, Black Cockatoo Valley, Goods and JusticeHub show the model in action and will compound impact nationwide over 2025-27.

---

## 1 ACT at a Glance

- **Purpose:** dismantle extractive systems by amplifying community-led solutions.
- **Method (H2W):** Listen → Curiosity → Action → Art, with every tool shipped alongside a sunset clause and “forkable” IP so communities can take full ownership .
- **Focus areas:** global justice innovation, storytelling for impact, nature for nurture, art for conceptualisation .
- **Flagship platforms:** Empathy Ledger (ethical story IP), JusticeHub (open justice network), Goods (circular essential products), Black Cockatoo Valley (regenerative conservation estate).

---

## 3 Choosing the Right Structure

ACT will operate a **dual-entity hybrid**: a not-for-profit Company Limited by Guarantee (charity pursuing DGR status) holding majority shares in a mission-locked trading company. This captures grant eligibility and tax concessions while allowing profits—from Goods manufacturing or BCV eco-cottages—to flow back to communities or the charity .

### Options Reviewed

| Structure | Community Ownership | Profit Rules | Funding Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-stakeholder Co-op | One-member-one-vote; multiple stakeholder classes | Dividends (if distributing) or full reinvestment (if non-distributing) | Grants for non-distributing co-ops; member capital & impact investors otherwise |
| CLG (Charity) | Mission-accountable members/board | No dividends; surplus reinvested | Strong grant & donation eligibility |
| Certified B-Corp Pty Ltd | Shareholder control; mission in constitution | Dividends allowed | Impact investment & trading revenue |
| Indigenous Corporation (CATSI) | ≥51 % Indigenous members/directors; ORIC oversight | No shares; reinvest or benefit members per Rule Book | Targeted Indigenous grants & procurement pathways |
| **Dual-Entity Hybrid** | Charity majority owns trading arm | Trading dividends flow to charity/community; charity never distributes | Grants + donations + investment + earned income |

*Recommendation:* proceed with CLG + trading co-op, embedding Indigenous governance where projects are place-specific .

---

## 4 Flagship “Seed” Projects

### Empathy Ledger

**Direct Community Engagement**: On-country visits, yarning circles, and embedded presence in communities.

**Digital Platforms**: Purpose-built tools for story sharing, data collection, and program delivery.

**Partner Networks**: Leveraging relationships to reach communities through trusted intermediaries.

**Events and Gatherings**: From conservation workshops to justice forums, creating spaces for connection and learning.

**Media and Communications**: Strategic use of stories to shift narratives and build support for systemic change.

### Customer Segments

Your "customers" are really partners and beneficiaries:

**Primary Beneficiaries**: Youth in or at risk of justice involvement, Indigenous communities seeking self-determination, single mothers needing pathways to employment, and individuals in recovery from addiction.

**Government Partners**: Agencies seeking community-led solutions to entrenched problems, from youth justice to conservation.

**Philanthropic and Impact Investors**: Funders looking for innovative, scalable solutions with deep community roots.

**Knowledge Seekers**: organisations wanting to learn from your models, researchers studying what works, and communities seeking to adapt your approaches.

### Type of Intervention

Your interventions operate at multiple levels:

**Systems Level**: Creating infrastructure for lasting change (JusticeHub, Empathy Ledger frameworks)

**Community Level**: Building collective capacity and ownership (Indigenous governance models, cooperative structures)

**Individual Level**: Direct support through employment, healing, and skill development

**Narrative Level**: Shifting stories to change how society sees and responds to issues

### Cost Structure

Your costs reflect your commitment to quality and sustainability:

**Human Resources (60-70%)**: Fair wages for skilled staff, community facilitators, and program participants.

**Program Delivery (15-20%)**: Materials, travel, technology development, and direct program costs.

**Infrastructure (10-15%)**: Maintaining physical and digital platforms, conservation land management.

**Administration (5-10%)**: Kept lean through efficient systems and shared services.

### Revenue Streams

Your diversified revenue model includes:

**Government Contracts (40-50%)**: Fee-for-service delivery of programs, research partnerships, and pilot projects.

**Philanthropic Grants (20-30%)**: Strategic funding for innovation and systems change work.

**Social Enterprise Revenue (20-25%)**: From Black Cockatoo Valley cottages, restaurant operations, and conservation credits.

**Impact Investment (Growing)**: Patient capital for infrastructure and scaling proven models.

### Social & Environmental Benefit

Your impact spans multiple dimensions:

**Social Impact**: Reduced youth incarceration, employment for marginalized communities, healing from trauma, and strengthened cultural identity.

**Environmental Impact**: Protected habitat for threatened species, carbon sequestration, regenerative land management, and connection between people and country.

**Economic Impact**: Community wealth building, local employment, circular economy models, and reduced government costs through prevention.

**Cultural Impact**: Preserved and shared Indigenous knowledge, shifted narratives about justice and conservation, and demonstrated alternatives to extractive models.

## The Integrated Picture

What makes A Curious Tractor's model powerful is how these elements reinforce each other. Your conservation work provides employment for people exiting justice systems. Your storytelling platforms generate revenue while protecting community knowledge. Your governance innovations ensure benefits flow to communities rather than being extracted.

This isn't just a business model – it's an ecosystem model where each element strengthens the others, creating resilience and amplifying impact. The Black Cockatoo Valley project represents the physical manifestation of this entire model, showing how all these pieces can work together in one place to create transformation that ripples outward.

Your challenge now is maintaining coherence as you scale, ensuring that growth strengthens rather than dilutes your core mission of regenerative impact led by and for communities.

# Innovative Business Structures for A Curious Tractor (ACT)

A Curious Tractor (ACT) is a community-driven social innovation venture with Indigenous collaboration. To support ACT’s goals – **legal clarity**, **access to funding**, **community ownership**, and **equitable profit-sharing** – several innovative yet legally viable Australian business structures can be considered. Below we explore a range of models (co-operatives, companies limited by guarantee, B-Corps, Indigenous corporations, dual-entity hybrids, etc.), analyzing their **pros and cons**, **funding eligibility**, **profit distribution rules**, **community engagement mechanisms**, and relevant **Australian examples**. We conclude with a comparison table and recommendations tailored to ACT’s mission.

## Co-operative (Multi-stakeholder Co-op)

A co-operative is a member-owned enterprise designed to serve its members’ common needs. Co-ops embody democratic governance (“one member, one vote”) and can formally include multiple stakeholder groups (e.g. workers, consumers, community members) in decision-making. Under Australian law (Co-operatives National Law and state/territory Acts), co-ops provide **legal clarity** through well-defined rules and a “rule book” constitution. Key features and considerations include:

- **Profit Distribution:** Co-ops can be **distributing or non-distributing**. Distributing co-operatives may return surplus profits to members (e.g. rebates or dividends), whereas non-distributing co-ops reinvest all profits into the co-op’s purpose. A non-distributing co-op meets the ‘not-for-profit’ definition, enhancing eligibility for charity status and grants. Distributing co-ops allow **equitable profit-sharing** among members but may be viewed as for-profit (limiting philanthropic grants).
- **Community Ownership & Governance:** Co-ops require a minimum of 5 members and are governed by an elected board. All active members have an equal vote regardless of shareholding. This ensures **community ownership** and engagement by design. A **multi-stakeholder co-operative** structure can include different classes of members (for example, workers, community investors, and beneficiaries), giving each stakeholder group representation in governance. This aligns well with ACT’s community-driven ethos, allowing Indigenous partners, local residents, and possibly supporters to all have a stake.
- **Funding & Compliance:** Co-ops are regulated at the state/territory level but based on harmonized national law, providing legal certainty. Non-distributing co-ops, being not-for-profit, can access government grants and philanthropic funding more readily (similar to charities), whereas distributing co-ops might rely on member capital contributions, community investment or social impact investors rather than donations. Some co-ops have creative financing models (member shares, community crowdfunding). Compliance involves registration with a state Registrar and ongoing reporting, though often with **lower fees or burdens** than for-profit companies.
- **Pros:** Democratic community control; **inclusive ownership** (members including those the enterprise serves); flexible profit distribution model (choice of reinvesting or sharing profits); limited liability for members; strong alignment with social purpose (co-ops exist to benefit members/community over maximizing profit). Co-ops foster high trust and engagement among stakeholders.
- **Cons:** Less familiar to traditional investors (if raising external capital, co-ops can’t issue public tradable shares easily; some limits on securing equity investment due to one-member-one-vote structure). Each state’s co-op law nuances require careful compliance. If profits are distributed, co-ops typically **cannot attain charitable status** (which may restrict access to certain grants). Scaling a co-op can be slower (“the slow food of social enterprise” ethos) and management must balance diverse member interests.
- **Australian Examples:** **Nundah Community Enterprises Cooperative (NCEC)** in Brisbane is a successful multi-stakeholder co-op. Founded to create jobs for people with disabilities, NCEC is a non-trading co-operative without share capital – all profits are reinvested to support its social mission. Its tagline emphasizes a “fair share” for worker-members, showing how co-ops enable **inclusive profit-sharing** through wages and community benefit rather than private dividends. Another example is **Hepburn Wind**, a community energy co-op in Victoria where local members invest in a wind farm and receive dividends (and renewable energy outcomes) – demonstrating a distributing co-op model owned by the community. Co-operatives in Indigenous contexts also exist (e.g. **Yappa Kurlangu Ngurra Art Co-operative** supporting Warlpiri artists), leveraging the co-op model to empower Aboriginal members. These cases illustrate that co-ops can be tailored to social innovation, giving communities direct ownership and voice in the enterprise.

## Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)

A Company Limited by Guarantee is a specialized corporate structure common for not-for-profits and charities in Australia. It is a separate legal entity without share capital – **members** guarantee a nominal amount (usually a few dollars) rather than holding shares, and **no dividends are paid**. Key attributes relevant to ACT:

- **Legal Clarity & Purpose:** A CLG must have a **non-profit purpose** (often charitable or community benefit) enshrined in its constitution, providing strong legal clarity about its mission. Profits cannot be distributed to members; any surplus must be reinvested into the organisation’s objectives. This ensures ACT’s work remains focused on social impact, and aligns with its current community-driven principles.
- **Funding Eligibility:** CLGs are particularly **attractive for government grants and philanthropic donations**. Donors and grant-makers typically require a bona fide not-for-profit structure – a CLG (especially if registered as a charity with the ACNC) meets this requirement clearly. Many philanthropic trusts and public funding programs explicitly restrict eligibility to entities that do not distribute profits, which gives a CLG an advantage in accessing **public or philanthropic funding**. Additionally, registering as a charity can confer tax exemptions and Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status, enhancing funding opportunities.
- **Community Engagement:** While CLGs don’t issue ownership shares, they can still incorporate **community involvement**. They may have a membership base (individuals or organisations who become members of the company) that elects the board, similar to an association. This membership can be open to community representatives, Indigenous partners, etc., to give stakeholders a voice. However, many CLGs operate with a relatively small member base (sometimes just the board itself) – so ACT would need to intentionally design the constitution for broad community membership if community governance is a goal. Nonetheless, even without broad membership, a CLG’s **accountability is to its mission and stakeholders** rather than profit, which suits ACT’s social objectives.
- **Pros:** Clear not-for-profit status (builds trust with funders); simple **legal framework under Corporations Act 2001**, regulated by ASIC (with oversight shifting to ACNC if a registered charity, reducing duplicate reporting). Limited liability for members. Able to hold assets, hire staff, and operate nationwide (unlike state-based associations). Strong signal of social purpose which can bolster credibility and compliance confidence.
- **Cons:** **No profit-sharing to private individuals** – by design, a CLG cannot distribute profits or equity, so this structure would **not allow ACT to directly share profits with community members** as dividends. Any financial benefit to the community must come through program activities, fair wages, or reinvestment in community projects, rather than ownership payouts. Also, a CLG cannot issue shares to raise equity capital; financing must come from grants, donations, or revenue. This can limit growth if substantial investment is needed (though it can borrow or use creative finance like social impact bonds or member loans). Governance in a CLG might be less directly “grassroots” unless a membership structure is implemented.
- **Australian Examples:** Many social enterprises and charities use CLG structures. **Orange Sky Australia**, the mobile laundry/shower service for people experiencing homelessness (co-founded by Nicholas Marchesi, also co-founder of ACT), is structured as a charity (likely a CLG), enabling it to receive philanthropic support and expand services nationally. **STREAT Ltd** (Melbourne) is another social enterprise (hospitality-based youth training) that operates under a company limited by guarantee, allowing it to receive grants and donations while running revenue-generating cafes. These examples show CLGs provide the **operational confidence and funding access** needed for mission-driven ventures, though they sacrifice the ability to share profits with private stakeholders.

## Certified B-Corporation (Benefit Corporation Paradigm)

**B-Corp** is not a legal structure in Australia, but rather a **certification** conferred by the non-profit B Lab to for-profit companies that meet high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. In practice, most Australian B-Corps are standard companies (often Proprietary Limited companies) that have chosen to embed a social purpose. This model is relevant to ACT if it wishes to operate as a **for-profit social enterprise** while demonstrating commitment to its mission. Key points:

- **Legal Structure & Mission Lock:** Since Australia doesn’t (yet) have a dedicated “benefit corporation” legal form, a B-Corp company uses existing structures (typically a **Pty Ltd company**) but may write its mission and stakeholder commitments into its constitution or shareholder agreements. For example, the social enterprise **Chuffed** (a crowdfunding platform) set up as a Pty Ltd and embedded its social mission in its governing documents – often described as a “Social Benefit Company” – proving that **traditional structures can be customized to protect social missions**. This approach provides legal clarity internally that profit isn’t the only goal, though it’s self-imposed rather than mandated by law.
- **Profit-Sharing:** A B-Corp (being a for-profit company) **can distribute profits** to owners/shareholders. This means ACT could reward investors or community shareholders with dividends if structured accordingly, achieving **equitable profit-sharing**. Unlike co-ops, voting power is typically proportional to share ownership unless modified. ACT could potentially offer shares to community representatives or an employee trust to involve them in ownership (though this strays into complex territory). B-Corp status itself doesn’t change profit distribution rules – it simply signals a balance of purpose and profit.
- **Funding Eligibility:** As a for-profit entity, a B-Corp company **would not be eligible for most grants or philanthropic donations** (which generally require non-profit status). However, B-Corps may attract **impact investors** and social finance capital. The credibility of B-Corp certification can help gain **investor and public trust**, opening doors to impact investment funds, ethical investment, or government social enterprise grants (some government programs support social enterprises regardless of structure). Also, nothing stops a B-Corp from trading successfully to fund itself – e.g., selling products or services to generate revenue for the mission. But purely philanthropic funding (e.g. charitable grants, tax-deductible donations) would not flow into a private company structure.
- **Community Engagement:** Being a standard company, community involvement isn’t built into governance (shareholders and directors control the company). However, B-Corp certification requires considering stakeholders’ interests. Many B-Corps build community engagement through practices rather than governance – e.g., regular stakeholder consultations, transparency reports, or partial community ownership via shares. It’s also possible to combine this with a co-op ethos by forming a **worker-owned or community-owned Pty Ltd** (though rare, it can be done by allocating equity broadly or via a cooperative of shareholders). In essence, **B-Corp provides a framework for accountability** but not a formal mechanism for community control.
- **Pros:** **Mission credibility and branding** – certification confirms ACT’s leadership in social innovation, which can attract customers, partners and ethically-minded investors. Full flexibility to pursue business activities and profit (no regulatory restrictions on trading or distributions). Limited liability and familiar corporate structure make it easier to deal with mainstream business partners. B-Corps form a supportive community of practice (network of other B-Corp companies) which can be advantageous.
- **Cons:** No intrinsic access to grants or tax-deductible funds (since it’s for-profit). The mission lock is not foolproof – future owners or directors could alter the constitution or drop the certification (though doing so might risk brand damage). External perception: some stakeholders (especially in communities ACT serves) might distrust a for-profit model, worrying about profit over purpose, so ACT would need to continuously demonstrate its social impact. Also, **certification is an added process** (impact assessments and audits by B Lab) and needs renewal, which is an extra administrative overhead.
- **Australian Examples:** **Who Gives A Crap**, an Australian toilet paper company, is a well-known B-Corp. They are a Pty Ltd that donates 50% of profits to sanitation charities, proving a profitable business can also deliver community benefit. By 2022 they had donated over AUD $8 million to impact projects. **SEFA (Social Enterprise Finance Australia)** is another Certified B-Corp – a finance company providing loans to social enterprises, illustrating how even a finance business can embed social objectives. These examples show that **B-Corp certification paired with a for-profit structure** can work for social innovation, but typically the enterprise must sustain itself via trading revenue and/or impact investment rather than donations.

## Indigenous Corporation (CATSI Act)

An **Indigenous Corporation** refers to an entity incorporated under the *Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (CATSI Act)*, overseen by the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC). This structure is tailored to Indigenous community organisations and enterprises. For ACT, which engages in Indigenous collaboration, an Indigenous corporation could be highly relevant, especially if the aim is to ensure **First Nations ownership, cultural governance, and access to Indigenous-specific support/funds**. Key features:

- **Indigenous Ownership & Control:** The CATSI Act requires that the corporation **must at all times be owned and controlled by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people**. In practice, the majority of members and directors must be Indigenous. This guarantees community ownership for Indigenous stakeholders – aligning with ACT’s goal of community ownership, if ACT’s projects directly involve Indigenous communities as core participants. The governance model expects a **larger membership base (minimum 5 members, often many more)**, and most directors must also be members. This culturally-informed model encourages collaborative decision-making and ensures those who govern have a direct stake in the community enterprise’s success. For ACT, if partnering with a particular Indigenous community, forming a CATSI Act corporation with that community would formalize their ownership and voice.
- **Legal Clarity & Support:** Indigenous corporations enjoy **no registration or annual fees and dedicated regulatory support from ORIC**. ORIC provides oversight, advice, and even “healthy corporation checks” to help early identification of issues – a level of support not available to ordinary companies. The CATSI Act also allows a corporation to consolidate its constitution and governance rules into a single **Rule Book**, which can be tailored to cultural needs (with flexibility to incorporate customary decision practices, etc.). This clear framework can give ACT operational confidence, especially in navigating Indigenous cultural protocols.
- **Profit Distribution:** A unique aspect is that **CATSI corporations cannot issue shares** – they are member-based like co-ops/CLGs. Profits aren’t distributed as dividends; instead, any distributions to members must be done according to rules in the Rule Book. Essentially, an Indigenous corporation can choose how to allocate surplus (for example, reinvest in community projects, provide services or benefits to members, or in some cases, direct payments if allowed by its rules). This is similar to a non-distributing co-op or a not-for-profit, although the Rule Book could permit certain forms of profit sharing among members for community benefit. Many Indigenous corporations are effectively not-for-profit (community or charitable organisations), but the structure **can accommodate enterprise activities and even profit, as long as managed for member/community benefit**.
- **Funding Eligibility:** Indigenous corporations often serve charitable or community purposes and can register with the ACNC if eligible. Even if not registered as a charity, many **government programs and grants for Indigenous initiatives prefer or require CATSI Act registration** because it assures Indigenous control. Being an ORIC-registered entity could open doors to Indigenous Advancement Strategy grants, Indigenous Business Australia support, and philanthropic funds focused on First Nations communities. The **Indigenous ownership credential** also helps in procurement (e.g. Supply Nation certification for contracts). However, like other NFP structures, if the corporation’s Rule Book disallows private profit distribution, it reassures funders that funds go to community outcomes.
- **Pros:** Ensures **Indigenous community ownership and cultural appropriateness**, which could strengthen ACT’s partnership with Indigenous stakeholders and long-term sustainability of projects in remote communities. **Enhanced governance support** from ORIC and often higher community trust in an Aboriginal-controlled entity. Eligible for specialized funding streams. Limited liability and clear legal status under federal law. The structure inherently promotes **community engagement** – large membership and requirement that most decision-makers are community members.
- **Cons:** Only viable if the project has substantial Indigenous leadership – ACT would need to ensure Indigenous people hold majority control, which might mean the original founders step back from majority governance if they are non-Indigenous. This could be a positive decolonizing step, but it’s a consideration. The **no shares** rule means limited direct investment options; capital raising has to rely on grants, loans or member contributions (similar to co-ops). Also, compliance with ORIC (while supportive) is another regulatory layer; the corporation must maintain Indigenous majority at all times, which limits flexibility in choosing management or partners. If ACT’s scope is broader than Indigenous communities, a CATSI corporation might limit non-Indigenous stakeholder participation in governance.
- **Australian Examples:** Thousands of Indigenous corporations operate nationwide. For instance, **Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation** in Arnhem Land manages enterprises and community services for its Indigenous members; **Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Corporation** (NT) supports Indigenous artists with profits returning to the community; and **Murra Warra Co-operative** (a Victorian renewable energy project) combined a co-op structure with Indigenous ownership principles. These illustrate how Indigenous corporations enable community-driven development. If ACT’s work in remote communities (e.g. manufacturing products from recycled plastic) is centered in a specific Indigenous community, an Indigenous corporation could allow that community to co-own and lead the venture, ensuring **cultural governance and equitable sharing of benefits**.

## Dual-Entity (Hybrid) Structure

A dual-entity or hybrid structure involves **two interlinked entities** – typically one **not-for-profit** (often a charity) and one **for-profit** – working in tandem. This model aims to capture the **“best of both worlds”** for social enterprises. For ACT, a dual structure could allow philanthropic fundraising through the not-for-profit side while enabling commercial activities and profit-sharing through the for-profit side. Common configurations include a Company Limited by Guarantee or Incorporated Association paired with a Proprietary Limited company. Key aspects:

- **Structure and Roles:** In a hybrid, the not-for-profit entity (e.g. a CLG or Indigenous corporation) might hold a mission-centric role – owning key assets, receiving grants/donations, and ensuring mission alignment – while the for-profit entity (often a Pty Ltd or co-op) carries out trading activities, generates income, and can distribute profits. **Legal agreements** or ownership ties link the two (for example, the NFP may own shares in the for-profit, or there may be contracts ensuring profits flow to the NFP). This setup must be governed by careful agreements to keep both parts aligned and compliant, but when done right it provides a very **robust governance framework**.
- **Funding & Profit Flow:** The not-for-profit side can have **charitable status** to tap into grants and tax-deductible donations, which it can use to fund research, community capacity building, or initial capital for the for-profit venture. The for-profit side can attract investment and generate profits by selling products or services. Those profits can then be **shared equitably** – either by **distributing to community stakeholders** (if, say, it’s a co-operative or has employee ownership), or by **channeling back to the NFP** as dividends or fees to support the mission. A prime example is **Thankyou Group**, a social enterprise where the for-profit Thankyou Pty Ltd is 100% owned by the Thankyou Charitable Trust – **every cent of profit goes toward ending extreme poverty** via the trust. This means Thankyou can operate as a competitive business and still direct all surpluses to its charitable purpose, achieving both impact and scale.
- **Community Ownership Mechanisms:** In a dual model, community engagement can be built into one or both entities. For instance, the NFP could be a **membership-based charity** (with community, partner, and Indigenous member categories influencing decisions), or even an Indigenous corporation, ensuring community voices govern the mission. The for-profit could be structured as a co-operative or include an **employee share scheme or community shareholders**. Because hybrids are flexible, ACT could custom-design how the community participates: e.g. the charitable arm might hold community workshops and include local leaders on its board, while the trading arm might employ community members and share profits through wages or dividends to a community fund.
- **Pros:** **Maximized funding opportunities** – can solicit grants and donations on the NFP side, while also raising investor capital or generating sales income on the for-profit side. Clear separation of charitable activities and commercial risk (the for-profit can undertake business operations without jeopardizing the charity’s compliance). Ability to **share profits with community/investors** through the for-profit, or funnel profits to the NFP for reinvestment. This addresses ACT’s dual goal of profit-sharing and philanthropic eligibility. Also, having two entities can protect the mission: the NFP owner can veto any mission-drifting moves of the business, for example.
- **Cons:** **Complexity** – maintaining two entities doubles the compliance (two sets of reports, boards, legal fees). Governance needs to be tight to manage the relationships and any conflicts of interest. It may be challenging to explain the structure to stakeholders (transparency and communication are key so communities understand how it works). Additionally, some grants might not fund a charity if the money ultimately could benefit a for-profit (mitigated by clearly separating funded activities). Care is needed to avoid the for-profit side gaining too much independence and drifting from purpose – formal mechanisms (like the charity owning majority of shares, or contractual profit share agreements) are needed to keep the hybrid integrated.
- **Australian Examples:** **Thankyou** is a hallmark example – a successful dual-entity social enterprise where the charitable entity owns the trading company, ensuring all profits go to impact. **STREAT** in Melbourne also uses a dual model: a charity that receives grants and donations alongside social enterprise cafes that generate income and provide training to youth (profits from the cafes support the training programs). Another example is **Food Connect** in Brisbane, which evolved a hybrid structure: it has a charitable trust and a trading arm (originally a co-operative) to balance community ownership with financial viability. These cases show that hybrid structures can be innovative solutions to meet multiple objectives, though they require careful design.

## Comparison of Structures

The following table summarises how each structure aligns with ACT’s key considerations: community ownership, profit distribution, and funding eligibility, with an example for context.

| **Structure** | **Community Ownership & Governance** | **Profit Distribution** | **Funding Eligibility** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Co-operative** (multi-stakeholder) | Member-owned (min. 5 members). Democratic one-member-one-vote control. Can include multiple stakeholder groups in governance. High community engagement by design. | **Two types:** Distributing co-op can share annual profits with members; Non-distributing co-op reinvests all profits in purpose (meets NFP definition). Profit-sharing only among member-owners (dividends or patronage rebates) not external investors. | Non-distributing co-ops can attain charity/NFP status (eligible for grants, tax exemptions) if aligned to a charitable purpose. Distributing co-ops have limited access to philanthropic grants (seen as for-profit), but can get member funding, impact investment, or certain social enterprise grants. | *Nundah Community Enterprise Co-op* – non-profit worker co-op reinvesting surplus to create jobs. *Hepburn Wind Co-op* – community investors receive dividends from renewable energy project. |
| **Company Limited by Guarantee** (CLG) | No owners/shareholders – members (who may be community representatives) guarantee a nominal amount. Governed by a board, accountable to members and ACNC/ASIC. Can allow broad membership to involve community, but often a small, purpose-driven membership. | **No profit distribution to members** (legal constraint). All profits must further the organisation’s purposes. Surpluses typically retained or spent on community programs. (Staff and suppliers can be paid fair value, but members don’t receive dividends). | High eligibility for **grants, donations, and philanthropic funding**. Often qualifies as a registered charity, unlocking government and foundation grants, and DGR (tax-deductible donations) status. Also eligible for volunteer support and other NFP benefits. Cannot offer equity to investors; relies on grants, donations, and earned revenue. | *Orange Sky Laundry* – CLG charity providing free laundry to the homeless, funded by donations and grants. *STREAT Ltd* – CLG social enterprise (youth training via hospitality) leveraging grants and reinvesting trading revenue. |
| **Certified B-Corp** (Pty Ltd company) | Private company with typical shareholder governance (voting by share ownership). No inherent community ownership, though founders can allocate shares to community foundations or employees. B-Corp certification encourages considering stakeholders, but decision control rests with shareholders. | **Yes, profit distribution allowed**. Can pay dividends to shareholders (including founders, investors, or even a community shareholder if one exists). No legal cap on profits – but many B-Corps voluntarily cap or redirect profits for impact. Flexibility to reward investors and potentially share profits with community via special schemes. | **Limited grant eligibility** – treated as for-profit. Generally **not eligible for philanthropic grants** or tax-deductible funds. Instead, can attract **impact investment, ethical investors, or earned income**. B-Corp status can enhance credibility with certain government social procurement or impact investment programs. | *Who Gives A Crap* – Pty Ltd certified B-Corp donating 50% of profits to charity (AUD$8.3M+ donated). *KeepCup* – sustainable products company (B-Corp) grown through sales and impact investor support, not grants. |
| **Indigenous Corporation** (CATSI Act) | Member-based **Indigenous community ownership** – majority of members and directors must be Indigenous. Governance via a Rule Book that can reflect cultural practices. Requires min. 5 members and typically involves broad community membership, ensuring local Indigenous community control. ORIC oversight adds accountability. | **Not-for-profit orientation** – cannot issue shares or pay dividends. Profits are either reinvested or distributed according to Rule Book (e.g. funding community projects or payments to members as approved). Effectively, private profit-taking is restricted; benefits are for members/community. | Strongly positioned for **Indigenous-specific grants** and philanthropy. Often registered as charities (if purposes are social/community). Some funders **require CATSI registration** as proof of Indigenous control. Can access mainstream grants as well, provided funds serve community purposes. Cannot seek equity investors due to share restrictions, but can form joint ventures or receive concessional loans. | *Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Corp* – supports Indigenous artists, reinvesting art sale proceeds into community (charitable purpose). *Kimberley Aboriginal Law & Cultural Centre* – Indigenous corporation preserving culture (eligible for government Indigenous grants). Many Indigenous enterprises (e.g. community art centres, service organisations) choose CATSI structure for community ownership and funding access. |
| **Dual-Entity Hybrid** (e.g. Charity + Pty Ltd) | **Mixed:** The charity (e.g. CLG or Indigenous corp) may have community members or public-interest governance (e.g. board of community leaders), ensuring mission alignment. The for-profit company can incorporate community ownership by being wholly or majority-owned by the charity (public benefit ownership) or by giving shares to stakeholders. Overall, the NFP parent provides community accountability over the for-profit’s activities. | **Flexible:** The for-profit arm can distribute profits as dividends, but typically those dividends flow to the charity owner or a community fund rather than individuals (if the charity is sole shareholder, all profits ultimately go back to mission). Alternatively, if community members hold shares, they can receive dividends directly. The charity arm, by contrast, does not distribute profit (it spends on programs). | **Maximum funding scope:** The NFP side is eligible for grants, donations, tax concessions, etc., while the for-profit can attract investors and earn commercial revenues. Philanthropic funds support the charitable activities or initial project development, and the business side ensures long-term income generation. Needs transparency to reassure funders that funds aren’t misused for private gain (usually structuring ensures they are not). | *Thankyou Group* – **dual structure** where a charitable trust owns the for-profit business, so **100% of profits fund the charitable mission**. *STREAT* – charity plus a portfolio of social businesses (cafes, bakery) whose profits help sustain the training programs. *Hireup* – disability support platform with a foundation alongside a tech company, enabling both investment and grants. These demonstrate hybrid models that leverage dual entities for impact. |

## Recommendations for A Curious Tractor (ACT)

For ACT’s mission of *community-driven innovation with Indigenous collaboration*, no single structure perfectly ticks every box; however, a **hybrid approach** or a carefully chosen primary structure with complementary mechanisms is recommended:

- **Leverage a Dual-Structure:** ACT should consider establishing **two entities working in tandem** – for example, a **Company Limited by Guarantee (or Indigenous Corporation)** as the primary not-for-profit body to anchor the mission and receive grants, alongside a **trading arm (e.g. a co-operative or B-Corp-style Pty Ltd)** for the manufacturing and income-generating activities. This hybrid would allow ACT to **access philanthropic funding and government grants (through the NFP)** while still enabling **profit-sharing with communities (through the trading arm)**. The not-for-profit entity (perhaps a CLG registered as a charity) could own a significant stake in the for-profit arm or have contractual rights to its profits, ensuring that **surpluses ultimately flow to ACT’s social purpose**. At the same time, community members (including Indigenous partners) could directly participate in the for-profit arm – for instance, as co-op members, employees with profit-share bonuses, or minority shareholders – to foster a tangible sense of ownership and reward.
- **Incorporate Indigenous Governance:** Given ACT’s Indigenous collaboration, if the project in remote communities is centered on Indigenous participants, **forming an Indigenous corporation for local operations** is highly advisable. This could either **be the primary not-for-profit vehicle** or a partner organisation. For example, ACT might support the creation of a local Indigenous corporation that runs the on-the-ground manufacturing hub, ensuring the community has majority control and cultural governance. This Indigenous corporation could then partner with or be partly funded by ACT’s main entity. Such an approach would satisfy Indigenous ownership criteria and make the initiative eligible for Indigenous-specific support. It also sends a powerful message: the communities are not just beneficiaries but co-owners of the solution.
- **Prioritize Community Co-ownership:** If using a single structure, a **multi-stakeholder co-operative** (potentially structured as non-distributing initially to attract grants) could be a strong choice. It would directly embody community ownership and democratic decision-making, and could later choose to distribute profits to members once sustainable. However, a co-op alone might limit funding avenues, so pairing it with a charitable entity (even as a minor partner or auspice) could be prudent.
- **Maintain Mission Lock and Clarity:** Whatever structure is chosen, ACT should codify its social mission – e.g. in a CLG or co-op constitution or in a Pty Ltd’s charter – to provide legal clarity and confidence. This could include **mission clauses, asset locks** (preventing distribution of assets to private hands on wind-up), and stakeholder engagement protocols. For instance, if ACT opts for a Pty Ltd with B-Corp ambitions, it should amend its constitution to require directors to consider community and environmental outcomes alongside financial returns. This helps preserve purpose even as the enterprise grows.
- **Case-by-Case Flexibility:** ACT might implement different structures for different projects (“seeds”) under its umbrella. One project could be housed in a co-operative with its specific community, another as a program under the ACT charity. An overarching **“group structure”** could hold these pieces together (for example, the ACT charity could be a common thread providing mentorship, fundraising and brand, while each community venture takes a form that best suits local stakeholder ownership, whether that’s a co-op, Indigenous corp, or a small business with local co-owners).

In summary, **a dual-entity strategy** – e.g. **ACT as a charitable company (CLG)** coupled with a **community co-operative or mission-led company** for enterprise activities – appears to best meet ACT’s goals of clarity, funding access, community ownership, and equitable profit-sharing. This approach has precedent in Australia’s social enterprise sector (as seen with Thankyou, STREAT, Food Connect and others) and is compliant with Australian law. It would allow A Curious Tractor to confidently pursue its vision of a “just, equitable, regenerative world” knowing its structure enables compliance, invites support from public/philanthropic sources, empowers the community as co-owners, and still provides mechanisms to share the fruits of success with those communities.

Ultimately, ACT should consult with legal advisors (and potentially the Indigenous community leaders involved) to fine-tune the structure – but with the models outlined above, ACT can cultivate an organisational framework as innovative and impactful as its mission.
