# ACT Galleries - Adding Photos and Videos

The Galleries page features a toggle between **Photo Harvest** and **Video Stories**, showcasing the beautiful work happening in ACT's community-led initiatives.

## üì∏ Adding Photos

### Method 1: Simple File Upload (Recommended for most photos)

1. **Add your photos** to the `public/galleries/photos/` folder
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`
   - Recommended size: 1200px wide or smaller for web optimization
   - File naming: Use descriptive names like `community-workshop-2024.jpg`

2. **Photos will appear automatically** with:
   - Title: Generated from filename (removes extension, replaces dashes/underscores with spaces)
   - Description: Default ACT-branded description

### Method 2: Custom Metadata (Recommended for curated galleries)

1. **Add your photos** to the `public/galleries/photos/` folder

2. **Create/edit** `public/galleries/photos/metadata.json` with custom titles and descriptions:

```json
[
    {
        "url": "/galleries/photos/your-photo.jpg",
        "title": "Community Wisdom in Action",
        "description": "Elder Mary shares traditional ecological knowledge with young gardeners at Black Cockatoo Valley"
    },
    {
        "url": "/galleries/photos/harvest-celebration.jpg",
        "title": "First Harvest Celebration", 
        "description": "The community celebrates their first harvest - proof that seeds of change can grow into forests of possibility"
    }
]
```

## üé• Adding Videos

Videos are managed through the `data/videos.json` file. You have several options:

### Option 1: Using the Video Helper Utility (Easiest)

```javascript
const { createVideoObject } = require('./utils/video-helper');

// Create video object from YouTube URL
const video = createVideoObject({
    url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID',
    title: 'Voices from the Field',
    description: 'Community members share their experiences with regenerative innovation',
    duration: '5:42',
    date: 'March 2024'
});

// Add to your videos.json file
```

### Option 2: Direct URL Conversion

**For YouTube videos:**
- Take any YouTube URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- Convert to embed: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ`

**For Vimeo videos:**
- Take any Vimeo URL: `https://vimeo.com/123456789`
- Convert to embed: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/123456789`

### Option 3: Manual Entry in videos.json

Edit `data/videos.json` directly:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Your Video Title",
        "description": "A compelling description that reflects ACT's voice and mission",
        "embedCode": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\" title=\"Your Video Title\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
        "duration": "5:42",
        "date": "March 2024"
    }
]
```

## üé® Brand Voice Guidelines for Galleries

### Photo Descriptions
- Focus on community ownership and leadership
- Use agricultural metaphors sparingly but authentically
- Highlight regenerative innovation in action

**Good examples:**
- "Community members tend to their shared garden, demonstrating how collective care yields abundant harvest"
- "Elders share traditional ecological knowledge with the next generation of land stewards"
- "Celebrating the first fruits of community-led regenerative agriculture"

### Video Descriptions
- Position community members as the experts and leaders
- Frame ACT as facilitator, not hero
- Use authentic voice attributes: Grounded yet Visionary, Humble yet Confident
- Include the impact of the story being shared

**Good examples:**
- "Local innovators demonstrate how waste becomes wealth through community-owned circular manufacturing"
- "First Nations elders teach us how caring for Country creates healing for both land and people"
- "Young entrepreneurs share how the Empathy Ledger is returning storytelling power to their communities"
